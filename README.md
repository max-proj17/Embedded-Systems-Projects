## Projects
### Project 1: LED Toggle with Out-of-Phase Blinking (Embedded_Lab_1)
- **Description**: This assembly program is designed to control two LEDs connected to an AVR microcontroller (ATmega328P). It toggles the LEDs in an out-of-phase manner, meaning when one LED is ON, the other is OFF and vice versa. The program utilizes two pins (PB1 and PB2) on port B of the microcontroller to control the LEDs and implements a delay function to manage the blinking rate of the LEDs.
- **Languages Used**: Assembly
- **Hardware Used**: ATmega328P microcontroller, LEDs, current-limiting resistors.
- **Key Concepts**: I/O port manipulation, subroutine calls for delay implementation, register operations, and loop constructs.

### Project 2: [Project Name]
- **Description**: Brief description of the project.
- **Languages Used**: C, Assembly
- **Hardware Used**: Specify any microcontrollers, sensors, etc.
- **Key Concepts**: Highlight any key concepts or techniques used (e.g., interrupts, low-power design, etc.)


## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: C, Assembly
- **Tools**: Mention any relevant tools or IDEs used (e.g., AVR Studio, MPLAB X, etc.)
- **Hardware**: List any microcontrollers, development boards, or other hardware that are frequently used in the projects.
