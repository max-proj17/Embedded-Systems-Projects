## Overview
This repository contains various projects and code snippets related to my Embedded Systems Projects! The projects encompass a range of applications and are developed using C, Assembly, and potentially other languages and tools related to embedded systems development.

## Projects
### Project 1: LED Toggle with Out-of-Phase Blinking (Embedded_Lab_1)
- **Description**: This assembly program is designed to control two LEDs connected to an AVR microcontroller (ATmega328P). It toggles the LEDs in an out-of-phase manner, meaning when one LED is ON, the other is OFF and vice versa. The program utilizes two pins (PB1 and PB2) on port B of the microcontroller to control the LEDs and implements a delay function to manage the blinking rate of the LEDs.
- **Languages Used**: Assembly
- **Hardware Used**: ATmega328P microcontroller, LEDs, current-limiting resistors.
- **Key Concepts**: I/O port manipulation, subroutine calls for delay implementation, register operations, and loop constructs.

### Project 2: Countdown Timer (Embedded_Lab_2)
- **Description**: The goal of this lab was to create a microcontroller-based countdown timer that is able to countdown between 1 and 25 seconds. The timer utilizes two cascading 8-bit shift registers, two seven-segment displays, and two pushbuttons. Operating the first pushbutton with a short press and release increments the displayed digit by one, and operating the same pushbutton with a long press and release resets the display to zero. Operating the second pushbutton will countdown from the number displayed at a rate of 1 digit per second.
- **Languages Used**: Assembly
- **Hardware Used**: ATmega328P microcontroller, 7-segment displays, shift registers, pushbuttons.
- **Key Concepts**: I/O port manipulation, subroutine calls for delay implementation, register operations, loop constructs, user input handling, and display control.

### Project 3: Seven-Segment Display Lock System (Embedded_Lab_3)
- **Description**: The goal of this lab is to create a lock system with a seven-segment display, push-button switch, RPG (Rotary Encoder), shift register, and ATmega328P. The RPG allows a user to increment and decrement from 0-9 and A-F where 9 jumps to A when reached. When a user presses the button the current value represented by the seven-segment display is recorded. The system waits for 5 button presses to evaluate whether the 5 character code entered was correct. If it is correct, the decimal on the seven-segment display will turn on as well as an LED on the Arduino Board for 5 seconds. If the passcode is incorrect an underscore will appear on the seven-segment display for 9 seconds. After either a correct or incorrect passcodeâ€™s animation has finished the system can accept a 5 character code again starting at a dash. The correct code for this implementation is E859A.
- **Languages Used**: Assembly
- **Hardware Used**: ATmega328P microcontroller, 7-segment display, push-button switch, RPG (Rotary Encoder), shift register.
- **Key Concepts**: I/O port manipulation, subroutine calls for delay implementation, register operations, loop constructs, user input handling, and display control.
